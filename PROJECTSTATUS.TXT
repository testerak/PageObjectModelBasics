Section 31 live projects course

NOTE 1 FOR ECLIPSE
Eclipse has started hiding the 'src' folder in some but not all 
of my projects and I would like to get it back. TO SORT TRY
right click on project
select properties
select java build path
goto source tab
click add folder
select your source folder (src/main/java)
I would also add src/main/resources, src/test/java, src/test/resources

NOTE 2 FOR ECLIPSE 
Absolutely, one can do it..
First You need to navigate to Build Path-->Configure Build Path--> Source tab
then in the Source tab search/check [your Project Name]/src/main/java and change
"contains test sources" from No to Yes and save it.
This will resolved issue of import packages from "src/test/java" to "src/main/java" successfully

NOTE 3 FOR ECLIPSE
eclipse not giving Suggestion about Attribute and Method not coming in Eclipse 
solve BY GOING TO
 'Windows > Preferences > Java > Editor > Content Assist > Advanced'
 THEN CLICK RESTORE DEFAULTS

PAGE OBJECT MODEL BASICS - ALL FUNCTIONALITY ON A PAGE IS 
ADDED TO A SINGLE PAGE CLASS  AND ALL FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN THAT PAGE 
IS ADDED BY CREATING METHODS FOR EACH OF THE FUNCTIONS / TEXT/ LINK ETC
====

POM SAME AS DATA DRIVEN COPIED FROM THERE
====
JAVA SET TO JDK AS MAVEN PROJECT
=====
STEP 1 MAIN/JAVA WILL CONTAIN BUSINESS CONCEPTS - PACKAGES (BUINESS PAGES LIKE HOMEPAGE, FOR TESTBASE CLASS) 
 SEE ECLIPSE NOTE 1

STEP 2 DATA(ALSO SOMETIMES NAMED AS EXCEL FOLDER),EXECUTABLES,LOGS,PROPERTIES(LOG4J,OR AND CONFIG), RUNNER

STEP 3 BUSINESS PAGE RESOURCES IN MAIN/RESOURCES -

STEP 4 SRC/TEST/JAVA - PACKAGES (ROUGH,LISTENERS,UTILITIES,TESTCASES)

STEP 5 TESTBASE CLASS CREATED AND EXTENDED ALL PAGES SO CONSTRUCTOR FROM EACH PAGE CAN BE REMOVED

STEP 6 ALSO WE CAN REMOVE DRIVER REFERENCE FROM TESTCASE (EXAMPLE LOGINTEST)

STEP 7 BROWSER DRIVER ALONG WITH SYSTEM PROPERTY MOVED TO TESTBASE CLASS AS WELL FROM TESTCASE
TESTCASE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY DRIVER INSTANCES LIKE DRIVER.FINDELEMENT ETC

STEP 8 A NEW NEW BROWSER IS BEING LAUCHED EVERY TIME SO WE COULD MAKE WEBDRIVER DRIVER DECLARATION AS PUBLIC STATIC 
AND CHECK IF BROWSER IS NULL USING IF (){} AS WE ONLY WANT TO LAUNCH ONE INSTANCE  


STEP 9 CREATING SEPERATE FOLDERS FOR EACH OF THE PAGES FOR EXAMPLE CRM, BOOKS RATHER THEN PUT ALL BUSINESS LOGIC UNDER PAGES

===================================
NOTE PAGE OBJECT MODEL INHERITANCE AND ENCAPSULATION
 Accounts page HAS A top menu
 homepage HAS A top menu
 so we can where ever there is a HAS A 
 relationship ENCAPSULATION takes place
 REMEMBER IS A RELATIONSHIP INHERTANCE IS IMPLEMENTED
 
 =======
 
STEP 10 SO WE CAN GOINTO EACH PAGE AND CREATE OBJECT OF TOPMENU BUT EASIER IS GO TO BASETEST PAGE AND DO IT THERE

STEP 11 WE NOW NEED TO MOVE CREATION OF OBJECT OF OTHER PAGES TO CALLING PAGE
EXAMPLE LOGIN PAGE OBJECT SHOULD MOVE TO METHOD LOGIN IN HOMEPAGE CLASS FOR EXAMPLE
AND WE DO NOT WANT NEW BROWSER LAUCHED EVERY TIME SO WE COULD MAKE WEBDRIVER DRIVER DECLARATION AS PUBLIC STATIC 
============
NOTE ECLIPSE TO CHANGE AND OR CHECK METHOD SIGNATURE PRESS CTRL+SHIFT+C
